# My first project - exploratory data analysis

This case study was part of the Advanced Data Analytics Bootcamp at neuefische. As our first longer project, we had 3 days to set up a project management and work through the tasks in groups of 4 people. It was centered around exploratory data analysis techniques and statistical analysis.

## Topic and task

Our task was to complete a case study to answer specific questions of our stakeholder by performing data analysis and visualisation. Our stakeholder was a fictional muesli delivery company for which we had to analyze the delivery process, compare target and actual performance and develop useful KPIs. 

## Where to find..
- [.. the task with detailed descriptions](Assignment.md).
- [.. all the code and visualizations](Muesli_Notebook.ipynb).
- [.. our Google Slides presentation as a pdf file](Google_slides_presentation-The_Muesli_Case.pdf).

## What did we use to work with
- A **Trello Board** for project management.
- **Google Sheets** for a first look at the data and the structure of the table. It consists of 4 sheets with data for all orders as well as specially collected data for individual steps of the delivery process.
- **Google Slides** for the stakeholder presentation.
- **Slack** and **Zoom** for our group work and presenting our findings.
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for writing the code and doing visualizations with **Python** and additional libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

# Project description for all groups

- Please create a new repository on GitHub and invite all team members to collaborate.
  - Include a .gitignore file to your repo. At the least your data folder should be listed, since you want to make sure not to push any data to GitHub.
- Start VS Code!
- Either use your nf_base environment or if you want to experiment with new packages:
  - Create a new virtual environment
  - Also after having created this environment, you can install additional packages within it. **Make sure you have activated your environment before installing new packages within it**!
  - Work in branches and push your changes to the repository in order to keep your notebooks synchronised.
  - Create a new .ipynb file and start with your EDA!
  - When working seperately from teammates use different files that can be combined later, or work carefully to avoid merge conflicts!


## Suggested workflow - MVP
The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write a plan of how you will complete the project. Refer to this regularly.
* When unsure or facing overly complex topics: make assumptions or simplifications that allow you to move on with your plan.
* Make simple plots
* Main questions should be answered first -> Think MVP (minimum viable product) and POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore (even if you spent loads of time on it!)
