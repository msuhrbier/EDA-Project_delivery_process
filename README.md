# My first project - exploratory data analysis

This case study was part of the Advanced Data Analytics Bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/data-analytics). As our first longer project, we had 3 days to set up a project management and work through the tasks in groups of 4 people. It was centered around exploratory data analysis techniques and statistical analysis.
Given that this project was in week 4 of the Bootcamp and the tools were still quite new to most participants, there was some guidance to get each group started.

## Topic and task

Our task was to complete a case study to answer specific questions of our stakeholder by performing data and statistical analysis and creating visualisation. Our stakeholder was a fictional muesli delivery company for which we had to analyze the delivery process, compare target and actual performance and develop useful KPIs. 
My group started working together to get an overview about the topic and possible KPIs. Through our project management we specialized in certain tasks over time. My focus was especially in the creation of the graphics and the final presentation.

## Where to find..
- [.. the task with detailed descriptions from neuefische](Assignment.md).
- [.. all the code and visualizations](Muesli_Notebook.ipynb).
- [.. the plots we created](plots).
- [.. our Google Slides presentation as a pdf file](Google_slides_presentation.pdf).

## What did we use to work with
- A **Trello Board** for project management.
- **Google Sheets** for a first look at the data and the structure of the table. It consists of 4 sheets with data for all orders as well as specially collected data for individual steps of the delivery process.
- **Google Slides** for the stakeholder presentation.
- **Slack** and **Zoom** for our group work.
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for writing the code and doing visualizations with **Python** and additional libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

# Project description for all groups

- Please create a new repository on GitHub and invite all team members to collaborate.
  - Include a .gitignore file to your repo. At the least your data folder should be listed, since you want to make sure not to push any data to GitHub.
- Start VS Code!
- Either use your nf_base environment or if you want to experiment with new packages:
  - Create a new virtual environment
  - Also after having created this environment, you can install additional packages within it. **Make sure you have activated your environment before installing new packages within it**!
  - Work in branches and push your changes to the repository in order to keep your notebooks synchronised.
  - Create a new .ipynb file and start with your EDA!
  - When working seperately from teammates use different files that can be combined later, or work carefully to avoid merge conflicts!


## Suggested workflow - MVP
The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write a plan of how you will complete the project. Refer to this regularly.
* When unsure or facing overly complex topics: make assumptions or simplifications that allow you to move on with your plan.
* Make simple plots
* Main questions should be answered first -> Think MVP (minimum viable product) and POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore (even if you spent loads of time on it!)
